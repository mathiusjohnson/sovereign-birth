      <p className="text-xl leading-8">Mother of 2 (soon to be 3), Radical Birth Keeper, Yoga Teacher, and Craniosacral Practitioner.  I work with empowered-knowledge seeking women who believe that birthing in sovereignty is their birthright.

      I believe with a deep passion that pregnancy &amp; birth belong to those experiencing the journey, and that the safest and most empowered journey is one that honors intuition and the body's intelligent design. 

      I approach pregnancy &amp; birth as innately healing life-events, and that they offer the opportunity to emerge into a felt sense of power, belonging, and knowing that was never realized until we crossed the threshold of birth in reverence and autonomy.
      
      Through holistic birth mentoring, conscious pregnancy practices, and birth support I walk along side pregnant and birthing bodies in identifying their birth vision, putting into action the steps necessary to support its manifestation, and holding space for the arrival into postpartum.  </p>
